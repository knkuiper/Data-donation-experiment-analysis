And #1 does not give any info, but I think that was the last version for me, so since I know the drill, I did not really notice to be honest. But in general, my preference would be #2.",NA,"Yes, I would probably be willing to","I like contributing to research :)  And if it's not too much of a hassle, or too much infiltrating of my privacy, I will.",NA,Group 6

However, the second version seems like an appropriate amount of info for instructions. I'd be good with version 1 as well, for this case, since I know it's a thesis study (high inital trust level).",NA,"Yes, I would definitely be willing to",I think providing data for the sake of research is a good thing to do (If it doesn't lead to ad optimization or such D:),NA,Group 5

The third version was the most detailed but not necessary as I have completed the process multiple times already. The first version was the least ensuring, because it came at the beginning, when I still felt unsure about the data anyways.",NA,"Yes, I would probably be willing to","In the end, it comes down to convenience. I did these subsequent donations because I did not have to download the data again. I believe if the data upload process would use means of a more automatic process to gather the data by using, for instance, Google APIs, people would be most willing to donate. However, this also needs to be permission/consent-based and on a moderate scale as it may lead to a new Cambridge Analytica controversy otherwise.",NA,Group 5
